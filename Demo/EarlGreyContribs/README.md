# EarlGrey Contribs

This sample project contains API's that are still in the experimental phase and need to be
further polished or analyzed before adding as an official EarlGrey API.

`EarlGreyContribs` is a simple project that contains two test targets -
`EarlGreyContribsSwiftTests` and `EarlGreyContribsTests`, both of which are added to
continuous integration.

It is recommended that if you add an API to either one of the targets, you try and replicate
it in the other as well.

## Getting Started

Similar to how the FunctionalTests project is set up, simply run the [setup script](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/tree/master/Scripts/setup-earlgrey.sh). You can then open `EarlGreyContribs.xcodeproj` which is already pre-configured to run the tests.
